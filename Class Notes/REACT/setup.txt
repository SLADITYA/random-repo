Setting Up a React Project
--------------------------

1. Bundlers: Bundlers are essential tools in modern web development.

- Minimize files: Remove whitespaces, comments, etc., resulting in smaller `.min.js` files.
- Create a server: Serve your application during development.
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR): Apply updates to your modules while the application is running, without a full reload.
- Optimize your project: Enhance performance by optimizing code.

Examples: Webpack, Parcel, Vite, etc.

A. Create-React-App (Deprecated)

- Utilizes Webpack as its bundler.
- Formerly a popular way to set up React projects, now considered outdated.

B. Vite

- A modern build tool that provides fast project setup and development speed.
- Acts as both a bundler and a build tool, enhancing the development experience.

npm (Node Package Manager)
--------------------------

npm is the largest single-language code repository, offering a vast library of packages for JavaScript development.

Key Concepts
------------

1. package.json: Contains metadata and configuration for your project.
   
2. Dependencies: External packages or libraries your project needs.

- Regular Dependencies (`dependencies`): Required for the application to run in production.
- Development Dependencies (`devDependencies`): Needed only during development, such as testing frameworks, build tools, or code quality tools.

3. npm install: Installs all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

4. package-lock.json: A more detailed version of `package.json` that ensures consistent dependency versions across different environments.

5. Scripts in package.json: Define custom commands that can be executed via npm, streamlining development tasks.
