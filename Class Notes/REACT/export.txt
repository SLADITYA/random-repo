DEFAULT EXPORT

- You can export only one component or module from a file.

NAMED EXPORT

- You can export multiple components, functions, or variables from a single file.

Key Points
----------

Curly Braces: Used for named imports to specify which components or functions you are importing.

- import { ComponentOne } from './MyComponents';

Rendering: No difference in rendering between default and named exports.
