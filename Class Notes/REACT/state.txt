States in React
---------------

1. State Variables

- Variables that, when changed, trigger the re-rendering of the UI (refreshing the DOM).

2. Hooks

- Hooks were introduced to React along with functional components.
- Simple JS functions that allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class.
- Hooks are created using the 'use' keyword.

3. useState

- The useState hook is used to create state variables in functional components.
- useState and other hooks are part of the React library.
- State variables created with useState are essential when you need to update the variable's value in the UI.
