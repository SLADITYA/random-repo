Components in React
-------------------

Component: A React component is a reusable piece of UI logic that can be either a JavaScript function or class, which outputs JSX to render elements on the page.

1. Functional Components: The modern approach, currently in use.
2. Class-based Components: The older method.

Functional Components
---------------------

Functional components are JavaScript functions that return JSX.

JSX:

- Stands for JavaScript XML.
- Not HTML, but it has an HTML-like syntax that allows us to render HTML within a JavaScript file.
- Can only return one parent element.

React Fragment:

- Acts as a parent element to help avoid adding unnecessary extra nodes to the DOM.
- Syntax: `<React.Fragment>...</React.Fragment>` or shorthand `<></>`.
