Understanding JSX and Its Conversion Process
--------------------------------------------

1. JSX AND THE DOM

The DOM (Document Object Model) cannot directly understand JSX.

2. ROLE OF JSX AND BABEL

JSX is a syntax that looks similar to HTML.

Babel, a JavaScript compiler, converts JSX into JavaScript objects.

3. REACT ELEMENTS

Functions like React.createElement() create React elements, which are JavaScript objects.

These JavaScript objects are then converted into HTML so that the DOM can understand and render them.

4. Conversion Process Overview
------------------------------

JSX: The initial syntax written by developers.

Converted to JavaScript Objects: By Babel.

Converted to HTML: That the DOM can render and understand.

JSX -> Converted to JavaScript Objects -> HTML that the DOM understands

Embedding JavaScript in JSX
---------------------------

You can write any piece of JavaScript code within JSX by enclosing it in curly braces {}.
