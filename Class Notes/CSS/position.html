    <!-- 
        Relative: Positions the element relative to its normal position.

        Absolute: Comes out of the DOM and the element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor.

        Fixed: Comes out of the DOM and the element is positioned relative to the browser's window.

        Sticky: Initially it acts as position relative and once on user's scroll it acts as position fixed.
