        Note: Flex property is not related to size (width and height).

    <!-- 
        By default, flex direction is row.

        If the flex direction is row, then x-axis is the main axis and y-axis is the cross axis

        justify-content works on main axis and align-items works on cross axis

        align-content: Aligns flex container's lines when there is extra space in the cross axis
    -->

    <!-- 
        Order: Controls the order in which items appear in the flex box. Default order of an item is 0.

        align-self: Just as align-items but works for a single flex item.
